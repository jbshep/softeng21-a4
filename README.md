1. In our UML diagram, should Task be a class or should it simply be a string?  Why or why not?
The Task should be a string. In this version, it is not quite clear what a task should be or what purpose it would serve. The Task 'class' in the UML does not have any data or member functions, so for now it is ok to implement the Task ambiguously as a string.

1. What future enhancements might you add to this project next?  Does the answer to this question change your answer to the first question?
Implement a Task class of some kind, and have it manage asignees, description, due date, ID, etc. and pass the tasks's name variable to Project.
It would change the answer to the first question because the UML represents it class and in the code it is a string. However, the UML represents the Task incorrectly, and should be a class.
